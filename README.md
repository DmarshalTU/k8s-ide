# Self-Hosted VS Code in Kubernetes

A secure, cloud-based development environment for DevOps/SRE teams, deployed
within your Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview

This setup provides a browser-accessible VS Code environment that runs directly
in your Kubernetes cluster. It's specifically designed for DevOps/SRE teams who
need a consistent, secure development environment with minimal local setup
requirements.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Minimal Local Setup
- No need to install multiple development tools locally
- Access your development environment from any device with a browser
- Consistent environment across team members

### 2. Enhanced Security
- Runs within your existing Kubernetes cluster
- Protected by your cluster's network policies
- Accessible only through VPN
- Authentication required for access

### 3. Resource Efficiency
- Computation happens on the server, not your local machine
- Shared resources within the cluster
- Scalable based on team needs

### 4. DevOps/SRE Specific Advantages
- Built-in access to cluster tools (kubectl, helm)
- Direct access to cluster resources
- Ability to manage the cluster from within the IDE
- Consistent tooling across the team

## Features

- **Persistent Storage**: Your code and settings persist between sessions
- **Resource Management**: Configurable CPU and memory limits
- **Built-in Tools**: Pre-configured with kubectl, helm, and other DevOps tools
- **Secure Access**: Protected by authentication and VPN
- **Customizable**: Extensible with VS Code extensions and settings

## Use Cases

1. **Remote Work**: Access your development environment from anywhere
2. **Team Onboarding**: New team members can start working immediately
3. **Cluster Management**: Direct access to cluster resources and tools
4. **Workshop Environments**: Quick setup for training sessions
5. **Resource-Constrained Devices**: Work on powerful servers from any device

## Security Considerations

- Access restricted to VPN users
- Authentication required for VS Code access
- Runs within cluster's security context
- Network policies control access
- Resource limits prevent abuse

## Maintenance

- Managed by the SRE team
- Updates handled through Kubernetes deployments
- Resource monitoring through cluster tools
- Backup and restore through persistent volumes

## Getting Started

1. Ensure VPN access to the cluster
2. Access VS Code through the provided URL
3. Authenticate with your credentials
4. Start developing with pre-configured tools

## Best Practices

1. Regular updates of VS Code and extensions
2. Monitoring of resource usage
3. Regular backup of persistent volumes
4. Review of access permissions
5. Maintenance of security policies

## Conclusion

This setup provides a powerful, secure, and consistent development environment
for DevOps/SRE teams. It reduces the need for local setup, ensures consistency
across the team, and provides direct access to cluster resources while
maintaining security through VPN and authentication requirements.
